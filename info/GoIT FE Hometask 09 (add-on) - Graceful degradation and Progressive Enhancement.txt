Introduction to Baselines

This section is non-normative.

A baseline is a line along the inline axis of a line box along which individual glyphs of text are aligned. 
Baselines guide the design of glyphs in a font (for example, the bottom of most alphabetic glyphs typically align with the alphabetic baseline), 
and they guide the alignment of glyphs from different fonts or font sizes when typesetting.

Different writing systems prefer different baseline tables.
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-3/images/alphabetic-baseline-in-two-font-sizes.svg

https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-3/images/script-preferred-baselines.gif

A well-constructed font contains a baseline table, which indicates the position of one or more baselines within the font’s design coordinate space. (The design coordinate space is scaled with the font size.)

In a well-designed mixed-script font, the glyphs are positioned in the coordinate space to harmonize with one another when typeset together. The baseline table is then constructed to match the shape of the glyphs, each baseline positioned to match the glyphs from its preferred scripts.

The baseline table is a property of the font, and the positions of the various baselines apply to all glyphs in the font.

Different baseline tables can be provided for alignment in horizontal and vertical text. UAs should use the vertical tables in vertical typographic modes and the horizontal tables otherwise.

4. Polyfills
-------------------------------------


* How to Build a Responsive Website That Supports Older Browsers
https://zellwk.com/blog/support-for-older-browsers/

...... If we didn’t want to use polyfills with IE8, we might have to stick to older coding standards which will either take up a lot of time, or
 make the website obselete easily in the future. When thinking along these lines, 
it seems that the gain better development process outweighs the cons of the slight performance drop with polyfills, 
and its well worth the effort.

4.4 Respond.js ->
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* A fast & lightweight polyfill for min/max-width CSS3 Media Queries (for IE 6-8, and more)
https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond

* Respond.js is a polyfill for CSS min-width and max-width media queries. 
It is extremely lightweight (3kb minified / 1kb gzipped) and that ensures that the script is downloaded and ran as quickly as possible.

4.5 Here are the 3 Polyfills You Might Want To Include In Your Project

4.5.1 { html5shiv }
==> It enables IE8 to support HTML 5 elements like <header> and <article> and you will need to use this polyfill if you have used html5 elements in your project.
 https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv

CDN ======> https://cdnjs.com/libraries/html5shiv/			https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5shiv/3.7.3/html5shiv.min.js

==> It enables IE8 to support HTML 5 elements like <header> and <article> 
==> and you will need to use this polyfill if you have used html5 elements in your project.

4.5.2 { Selectivizr, CSS3 selectors for Internet Explorer}
http://selectivizr.com/

==> is a JavaScript utility that emulates CSS3 pseudo-classes and attribute selectors in Internet Explorer 6-8. 
Simply include the script in your pages and selectivizr will do the rest.

==> These pseudo-classes, like nth-child and last-child, have to be used to create smarter HTML layouts that can adjust itself when viewports changes.

4.5.2. 

4.5.3. REM Unit Polyfill
The REM-unit-polyfill is a polyfill for the REM unit. You will need this polyfill if you use the REM unit in your CSS.

Linking Around Block-Level El ements
by John Duckett /  HTML & CSS Design and Build Web Sites - 441page
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* HTML5 allows web page authors to place an <a> element around
a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.
* This is not a new element in HTML5, but it was not seen as a correct usage of the <a> element
in earlier versions of HTML.

* by MDN => The HTML Anchor Element (<a>) creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, 
email addresses, or any other URL.
* Permitted content	{ Transparent, containing either flow content (excluding interactive content) or phrasing content. }

.menu---blue .menu_item {
	
}

= Oleg says that tWe can do CASCAD-ing for relatively to a modifier !!!!!
= !!!! In fact, He didn't realized the .menu--blue class but he do the usual CASCAD-ing in the scope of .menu--blue.
Moreover, an element menu__item should be changed, described through its own BEM-modifiers only, 
there should be other modifiers presented in the form of CSS-classes !!!!
= He further says, he has built an independed block, i.e. "menu menu--blue" !!!
But BEM says every block should be independant from contect where it resides.
So, we could put it in any place of the DOM-hierarchy !!!
But if the create another block even resembling the first mentioned one, we have to declare other clasess for it !!!!!

At the end of the lesson he again says about the new built class called menu--blue. I am saying again there is no new declared class "menu--blue".


But BEM says almost CHANGES for a block/element should be reached through applying CLASS-es !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the stacking order rules ::
"... there are seven possible levels on each stacking context, which are listed below.

Background and borders — of the element forming the stacking context. The lowest level in the stack.
Negative Z-Index — the stacking contexts of descendants elements with negative z-index.
Block Level Boxes — in-flow non-inline-level non-positioned descendants.
Floated Boxes — non-positioned floats
Inline Boxes — in-flow inline-level non-positioned descendants.
Z-index: 0 — positioned elements. These form new stacking contexts.
Positive Z-index — positioned elements. The highest level in the stack."
